SOS (Save Our Settings)

I've always been frustrated by making changes to staging on the launchpad, 
and then losing those changes when reverting to the editor.  Ergo, this mod.

SOS will allow you to save changes made to the staging, axis groups and 
action groups while on the launch pad and runways.  It works silently 
except when  you actually do a revert

When doing a revert, you will be presented with toggles below the 
revert/pause menu which will let you select which group to save.  In order 
to do this I had to reimplement the Pause menu as you will see in the following images:

A normal pause before a revert will display the following menu:

A pause after changing the staging will have the following:

and a pause after changing all three will be:

The (BLSG not available) refers to Better Load Save Game, which is used to replace the stock Load Save.
Due to the way the menu is implemented, I can't access the normal Load Save Game menu item.

Note that this mod is fully Localized.  It mostly uses stock labels, there are a seven custom labels in 
the dictionary.cfg file, currently en-us only.  Translations are welcome

Thanks to the following people for their excellent suggestions which helped me come up with the final name:
